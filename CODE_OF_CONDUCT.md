# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members of Astoria Tech Group pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
*   Focusing on what is best for the community
*   Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
*   Vandalizing or otherwise disrespecting the venues where Astoria Tech Group events are held
*   As some events take place in locations that serve alcohol: Forcing/pressuring others to drink
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

To continue growing a safe, welcoming, and fair community, all Astoria Tech Group members are empowered to call out and attempt to resolve harmful behavior, and admins are empowered to enforce the Code of Conduct.

If you see someone behaving harmfully, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior.

If you experience harmful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of the leaders who will listen and work to resolve the matter.

Leaders have the right and responsibility to delete comments or messages in Astoria Tech Group-related communication channels (e.g. Meetup, Slack, etc.) that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to any/all persons who attend Astoria Tech Group events, who are members of the Astoria Tech Group Slack team or Meetup.com page, who contribute to projects on the Astoria Tech Group GitHub organization, or who otherwise participate or are affiliated with Astoria Tech Group in any way.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Astoria Tech Group Leadership team.  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The leadership team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the Astoria Tech Group leadership team.
